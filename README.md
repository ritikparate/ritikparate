# 👋 Hi, I'm Ritik Parate

🚀 **ETL Support Engineer @ Smile Automation** | 🧠 **Aspiring Data Engineer**

### 👨‍💻 About Me

I work in the **ETL Support** domain, where I handle data pipelines and ensure smooth data processing for enterprise systems.
With a strong foundation in **SQL**, **Python**, and **Excel**, I love solving real-world data problems and optimizing workflows.

Currently, I’m diving deep into the **Data Engineering ecosystem** — learning tools and technologies like:

* ⚙️ **PySpark** for distributed data processing
* 🌪️ **Kafka** for real-time streaming
* ☁️ **AWS** for cloud-based data solutions
* 🔄 **Airflow** for workflow orchestration
* 🧩 **CI/CD** diving deep into pipelines for automation

### 🎯 My Goal

To transition into a **Data Engineering role** within the next 6 months — building scalable, production-grade data systems that truly make an impact.

---

### 🧠 What I’m Up To

* Learning by doing — building small data projects & sharing them here.
* Exploring how automation, data quality, and system reliability come together in modern data platforms.
* Networking with professionals and data enthusiasts to learn from their journeys.
