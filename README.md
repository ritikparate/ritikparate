🚀 ETL Support Engineer @ Smile Automation | 🌩️ Growing into an Azure Data Engineer

👨‍💻 About Me

I work across ETL Support and data pipeline operations, ensuring data flows smoothly across enterprise systems. I enjoy breaking down complex data problems and turning them into clean, efficient workflows using SQL, Python, and automation.

Recently, I’ve expanded into the Azure Data Engineering ecosystem, building real-time and batch solutions using:

⚙️ PySpark for scalable transformations

🌪️ Kafka for streaming ingestion

🌩️ Azure Data Lake + Azure Databricks for storage & processing

🔄 Azure Data Factory for orchestration

🧩 CI/CD for automated deployments

🔥 What I’m Working On

Building an end-to-end Azure data pipeline project using PySpark, ADF, ADLS, and Databricks

Designing real-time ingestion workflows for analytics use cases

Experimenting with data quality, automation, and monitoring practices

🎯 My Goal

Transition into a Data Engineering role — contributing to scalable, production-grade data platforms in the next 6 months.
